    Welcome to siege.sh
    <br>
    Welcome to my playground. I'm a solutions architect and security specialist who loves working with high-traffic systems and cloud infrastructure.
    <br>
    I'm passionate about keeping systems secure and running smoothly - it's why I got my CISSP certification and why I love diving into
    complex architectural challenges. Over my 20+ year career, I've worked with everything from legacy systems to cutting-edge cloud tech,
    using languages like Go and Python to build robust, scalable solutions.
    <br><br>
    Beyond the world of tech, my other great passion is electronic music. As a DJ, I love exploring different genres and sharing that journey with others.
